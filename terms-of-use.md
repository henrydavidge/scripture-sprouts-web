# Scripture Sprouts - Terms of Service

**Effective Date:** March 26, 2025

**1. Acceptance of Terms & Acknowledgement**

Welcome to Scripture Sprouts! These Terms of Service ("Terms") constitute a legally binding agreement concluded solely between you ("User" or "you") and Sirenia LLC ("Sirenia," "we," "us," or "our"), and not with Apple Inc. ("Apple"), regarding your use of the Scripture Sprouts mobile application and any related services (collectively, the "Application"). Sirenia LLC, not Apple, is solely responsible for the Application and the content thereof. These Terms may not provide for usage rules for the Application that are in conflict with the Apple Media Services Terms and Conditions as of the Effective Date (which you acknowledge you have had the opportunity to review).

**By accessing or using the Application, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms and our [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy/), which is incorporated herein by reference.** If you do not agree to these Terms or the Privacy Policy, you must not access or use the Application.

**Age Requirement:** The Application is intended solely for users who are 13 years of age or older. By using the Application, you represent and warrant that you meet this age requirement.

**2. Description of Service**

The Application provides access to publicly available biblical texts (including the King James Version and World English Bible) and utilizes artificial intelligence ("AI") powered features, such as chat and commentary, to provide interpretations, explanations, and related content for informational and devotional purposes (the "Service").

**AI Content Disclaimer:** AI-generated content is based on algorithms and data, provided for informational purposes only, and should be considered as opinion. **It is not intended to be, and should not be taken as, authoritative doctrine, theological advice, or a substitute for guidance from qualified religious leaders.**

**Service Availability:** The Application is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. We do not guarantee that the Service will always be available, uninterrupted, or error-free.

**3. User Accounts**

Access to certain features of the Application may require you to create an account, potentially using "Sign In with Apple." You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account information and for all activities that occur under your account. You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account.

**4. User-Generated Content (UGC)**

* **Ownership:** You retain ownership of the original content you create or submit within the Application, such as personal notes or prompts entered into chat features ("User-Generated Content" or "UGC").
* **License Grant:** By creating or submitting UGC, you grant Sirenia LLC a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide, sublicensable license to use, reproduce, modify (e.g., for technical formatting), display, distribute, and prepare derivative works of your UGC solely in connection with operating, developing, providing, and improving the Service and our other products and services. You represent and warrant that you have all necessary rights to grant this license.
* **Responsibility:** You are solely responsible for your UGC and the consequences of posting or publishing it. We do not endorse any UGC or any opinion, recommendation, or advice expressed therein, and we expressly disclaim any and all liability in connection with UGC. We reserve the right to remove UGC without prior notice.

**5. License to Use the Application**

*   **License Grant:** Subject to your compliance with these Terms, Sirenia LLC grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to download and install a copy of the Application on any Apple-branded product that you own or control and to run such copy of the Application solely for your own personal, non-commercial purposes as permitted by the Usage Rules set forth in the Apple Media Services Terms and Conditions (the "Usage Rules"). This license does not allow you to use the Application on any Apple device that you do not own or control, and except as provided in the Usage Rules, you may not distribute or make the Application available over a network where it could be used by multiple devices at the same time. This license is granted to you only, and does not permit the Application to be accessed and used by other accounts associated with you via Family Sharing or volume purchasing unless explicitly permitted by the Usage Rules.
*   **Restrictions:** Except as expressly permitted in these Terms or under applicable law, you may not: (a) copy (except as permitted by this license and the Usage Rules), modify, or create derivative works based on the Application; (b) distribute, transfer, sublicense, lease, lend, or rent the Application to any third party; (c) reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Application, attempt to derive its source code (except as and only to the extent that any foregoing restriction is prohibited by applicable law or to the extent as may be permitted by the licensing terms governing use of any open-sourced components included with the Application); or (d) make the functionality of the Application available to multiple users through any means unless explicitly permitted by the Usage Rules. If you sell your Apple device to a third party, you must remove the Application from the device before doing so. Sirenia LLC reserves all rights in and to the Application not expressly granted to you under these Terms.

**6. Maintenance and Support**

Sirenia LLC is solely responsible for providing any maintenance and support services with respect to the Application, as specified in these Terms, or as required under applicable law. You acknowledge that Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the Application.

**7. Consent to Use of Data**

You agree that Sirenia LLC may collect and use technical data and related information—including but not limited to technical information about your device, system and application software, and peripherals—that is gathered periodically to facilitate the provision of software updates, product support, and other services to you (if any) related to the Application. Sirenia LLC may use this information, as long as it is in a form that does not personally identify you, to improve its products or to provide services or technologies to you. Our collection and use of personal information is further described in our [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy/).

**8. External Services**

The Application may enable access to Sirenia LLC's and/or third-party services and websites (collectively and individually, "External Services"). You agree to use the External Services at your sole risk. Sirenia LLC is not responsible for examining or evaluating the content or accuracy of any third-party External Services, and shall not be liable for any such third-party External Services. Data displayed by any Application or External Service is for general informational purposes only and is not guaranteed by Sirenia LLC or its agents. You will not use the External Services in any manner that is inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement or that infringes the intellectual property rights of Sirenia LLC or any third party. You agree not to use the External Services to harass, abuse, stalk, threaten or defame any person or entity, and that Sirenia LLC is not responsible for any such use. External Services may not be available in all languages or in your country, and may not be appropriate or available for use in any particular location. To the extent you choose to use such External Services, you are solely responsible for compliance with any applicable laws. Sirenia LLC reserves the right to change, suspend, remove, disable or impose access restrictions or limits on any External Services at any time without notice or liability to you.

**9. Disclaimer of Warranties**

YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT USE OF THE APPLICATION AND THE SERVICE IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE APPLICATION AND ANY SERVICES PERFORMED OR PROVIDED BY THE APPLICATION ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE," WITH ALL FAULTS AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, AND SIRENIA LLC HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE APPLICATION AND ANY SERVICES, EITHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OF ACCURACY, OF QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND OF NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD-PARTY RIGHTS. SIRENIA LLC DOES NOT WARRANT AGAINST INTERFERENCE WITH YOUR ENJOYMENT OF THE APPLICATION, THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN, OR SERVICES PERFORMED OR PROVIDED BY, THE APPLICATION WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, THAT THE OPERATION OF THE APPLICATION OR SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS IN THE APPLICATION OR SERVICES WILL BE CORRECTED. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY SIRENIA LLC OR ITS AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY. SHOULD THE APPLICATION OR SERVICES PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE ENTIRE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR, OR CORRECTION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR LIMITATIONS ON APPLICABLE STATUTORY RIGHTS OF A CONSUMER, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION AND LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

Sirenia LLC is solely responsible for any product warranties, whether express or implied by law, to the extent not effectively disclaimed above. In the event of any failure of the Application to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify Apple, and Apple will refund the purchase price (if any) for the Application to you. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the Application, and any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs, or expenses attributable to any failure to conform to any warranty will be Sirenia LLC's sole responsibility.

**10. Product Claims**

You and Sirenia LLC acknowledge that Sirenia LLC, not Apple, is responsible for addressing any claims you or any third party may have relating to the Application or your possession and/or use of the Application, including, but not limited to: (i) product liability claims; (ii) any claim that the Application fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (iii) claims arising under consumer protection, privacy, or similar legislation. These Terms do not limit Sirenia LLC's liability to you beyond what is permitted by applicable law.

**11. Intellectual Property Rights**

You and Sirenia LLC acknowledge that, in the event of any third-party claim that the Application or your possession and use of the Application infringes that third party's intellectual property rights, Sirenia LLC, not Apple, will be solely responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement, and discharge of any such intellectual property infringement claim.

**12. Limitation of Liability**

TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL SIRENIA LLC BE LIABLE FOR PERSONAL INJURY OR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR ANY OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE APPLICATION OR SERVICE, HOWEVER CAUSED, REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY (CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) AND EVEN IF SIRENIA LLC HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR PERSONAL INJURY, OR OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. In no event shall Sirenia LLC's total liability to you for all damages (other than as may be required by applicable law in cases involving personal injury) exceed the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00). The foregoing limitations will apply even if the above stated remedy fails of its essential purpose.

**13. Termination**

These Terms are effective until terminated by you or Sirenia LLC. Your rights under these Terms will terminate automatically if you fail to comply with any of its provisions. Upon termination, you shall cease all use of the Application and destroy all copies, full or partial, of the Application. Sections 1, 4, 5(*), 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19 will survive any termination. (*Note: Specific subsections like 5(b) are included within the survival of Section 5).
