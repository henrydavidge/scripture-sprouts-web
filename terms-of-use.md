**Effective Date:** March 26, 2025

**1. Acceptance of Terms**

Welcome to Scripture Sprouts! These Terms of Service ("Terms") constitute a legally binding agreement between you ("User" or "you") and Sirenia LLC ("Sirenia," "we," "us," or "our") regarding your use of the Scripture Sprouts mobile application and any related services (collectively, the "Application").

**By accessing or using the Application, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms and our [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy/), which is incorporated herein by reference.** If you do not agree to these Terms or the Privacy Policy, you must not access or use the Application.

**Age Requirement:** The Application is intended solely for users who are 13 years of age or older. By using the Application, you represent and warrant that you meet this age requirement.

**2. Description of Service**

The Application provides access to publicly available biblical texts (including the King James Version and World English Bible) and utilizes artificial intelligence ("AI") powered features, such as chat and commentary, to provide interpretations, explanations, and related content for informational and devotional purposes (the "Service").

**AI Content Disclaimer:** AI-generated content is based on algorithms and data, provided for informational purposes only, and should be considered as opinion. **It is not intended to be, and should not be taken as, authoritative doctrine, theological advice, or a substitute for guidance from qualified religious leaders.**

**Service Availability:** The Application is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. We do not guarantee that the Service will always be available, uninterrupted, or error-free.

**3. User Accounts**

Access to certain features of the Application may require you to create an account, potentially using "Sign In with Apple." You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account information and for all activities that occur under your account. You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account.

**4. User-Generated Content (UGC)**

* **Ownership:** You retain ownership of the original content you create or submit within the Application, such as personal notes or prompts entered into chat features ("User-Generated Content" or "UGC").
* **License Grant:** By creating or submitting UGC, you grant Sirenia LLC a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide, sublicensable license to use, reproduce, modify (e.g., for technical formatting), display, distribute, and prepare derivative works of your UGC solely in connection with operating, developing, providing, and improving the Service and our other products and services. You represent and warrant that you have all necessary rights to grant this license.
* **Responsibility:** You are solely responsible for your UGC and the consequences of posting or publishing it. We do not endorse any UGC or any opinion, recommendation, or advice expressed therein, and we expressly disclaim any and all liability in connection with UGC. We reserve the right to remove UGC without prior notice.

**5. License to Use the Application**

*   **License Grant:** Subject to your compliance with these Terms, Sirenia LLC grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to download and install a copy of the Application on a mobile device that you own or control and to run such copy of the Application solely for your own personal, non-commercial purposes. This license extends to use on any Apple-branded products that you own or control and as permitted by the Apple App Store Terms of Service ("Usage Rules").
*   **Restrictions:** Except as expressly permitted in these Terms or under applicable law, you may not: (a) copy, modify, or create derivative works based on the Application; (b) distribute, transfer, sublicense, lease, lend, or rent the Application to any third party; (c) reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Application; or (d) make the functionality of the Application available to multiple users through any means, including over a network where it could be used by multiple devices at the same time. If you sell your Apple device to a third party, you must remove the Application from the device before doing so. Sirenia LLC reserves all rights in and to the Application not expressly granted to you under these Terms.

**6. Consent to Use of Data**

You agree that Sirenia LLC may collect and use technical data and related information—including but not limited to technical information about your device, system and application software, and peripherals—that is gathered periodically to facilitate the provision of software updates, product support, and other services to you (if any) related to the Application. Sirenia LLC may use this information, as long as it is in a form that does not personally identify you, to improve its products or to provide services or technologies to you. Our collection and use of personal information is further described in our [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy/).

**7. External Services**

The Application may enable access to Sirenia LLC's and/or third-party services and websites (collectively and individually, "External Services"). You agree to use the External Services at your sole risk. Sirenia LLC is not responsible for examining or evaluating the content or accuracy of any third-party External Services, and shall not be liable for any such third-party External Services. Data displayed by any Application or External Service is for general informational purposes only and is not guaranteed by Sirenia LLC or its agents. You will not use the External Services in any manner that is inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement or that infringes the intellectual property rights of Sirenia LLC or any third party. You agree not to use the External Services to harass, abuse, stalk, threaten or defame any person or entity, and that Sirenia LLC is not responsible for any such use. External Services may not be available in all languages or in your country, and may not be appropriate or available for use in any particular location. To the extent you choose to use such External Services, you are solely responsible for compliance with any applicable laws. Sirenia LLC reserves the right to change, suspend, remove, disable or impose access restrictions or limits on any External Services at any time without notice or liability to you.

NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY SIRENIA LLC OR ITS AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY. SHOULD THE APPLICATION OR SERVICES PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE ENTIRE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR, OR CORRECTION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR LIMITATIONS ON APPLICABLE STATUTORY RIGHTS OF A CONSUMER, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION AND LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR PERSONAL INJURY, OR OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. In no event shall Sirenia LLC's total liability to you for all damages (other than as may be required by applicable law in cases involving personal injury) exceed the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00). The foregoing limitations will apply even if the above stated remedy fails of its essential purpose.

**10. Termination**

These Terms are effective until terminated by you or Sirenia LLC. Your rights under these Terms will terminate automatically if you fail to comply with any of its provisions.
